# Obtaining a Credal API Key

To obtain a Credal.ai API key, head to the [API Tokens section](https://app.credal.ai/api-tokens) on the Credal app.

Here, you should see a list of API tokens you've already created, and a button to create a new one.

Click the "Create new token" button to open the token creation dialog.

Once it opens, add a title, description, and expiration date for your token.
